1
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:24,972
Between le Australia and le South America,
in le South Pacific Ocean…

2
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,350
… the Pom Pom Galli atoll.

3
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:41,432
V12 to captain George Abitbol,
someone needs you on the desk.

4
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,608
— Who ?
— some José guy.

5
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:45,058
OK, I'm coming.

6
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:52,508
Here is finally the king of class !
The too-well dressed, Abitbol !

7
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,558
You've been elected the classiest
man on earth ? Don't make me laugh!

8
00:00:57,608 --> 00:01:02,408
Like, the big seabed Playboy,
the housewifes's dream

9
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,658
But, me, I fuck them,
the housewifes. Don't I ?

10
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,908
Listen to me Jose, you fuck housewifes ?
Good. You must have a shiny ass.

11
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:14,435
But that's not what I call class. And that
comes from the classiest man on earth

12
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:19,014
Let me stop you right now !
Being classy is about dressing chic

13
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:21,864
There's nothing like shopping 
at Azzedine Alaïa…

14
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,414
…or buying turtlenecks
from Yohji Yamamoto.

15
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:28,764
My poor José,
you are mixing everything

16
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:32,114
You are confusing
coquetry and class.

17
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:36,164
You are crazy, you spending every
dime on clothes and accessories.

18
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:38,714
But you are foolish

19
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:44,245
Anyway… You're the one wearing those
But in my opinion, you look has been.

20
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:47,916
Bugger me !
Me, I look has been ?

21
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:52,566
I'm wearing for more than 10 grands !
So go fuck yourself !

22
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:54,816
You are not very nice.

23
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,466
But the train of your insults
runs on the rails of my indifference.

24
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:01,616
I prefer leaving rather than hearing that
rather that being deaf

25
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,166
Consider we're not friends anymore
Abitbol !

26
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:21,629
The Redcoats have landed, we'll have to go
from the back. You know, that dirty dark tunnel

27
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,546
George, what a poet !
You amaze me.

28
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:30,896
I've known men before
but none like you

29
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:33,846
- Eh, you know who you speak to !
— Yes !

30
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:38,508
- Let's shelter, it's gonna blow up
- And that's nothing !

31
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,358
Move away, let me pass

32
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,672
- V12, what's that mess ?
- That mess is that it's rainging dogs and cats

33
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:50,104
Bravo, thanks for the tip
Thankfully you're here !

34
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:54,910
You want me to tell everyone
Your real name is Porc-ribs Salt-and-pepper

35
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,114
I'm gonna get towels
with prints on them

36
00:02:58,164 --> 00:03:01,149
Ah, This one… no.

37
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:04,885
This one ?
Yeah, this one is OK.

38
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,193
That's allright, it's sponged

39
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:10,105
That's allright, it's fixed

40
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:13,039
This  rolls

41
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:16,945
Fuck and that ?
We can't leave it like that

42
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:25,312
George !
Oh my god, George !

43
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:31,639
Ah, shitty world !

44
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,789
Oh George…

45
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:44,096
<i>The main information for today,
The disparition of George Abitbol…</i>

46
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:47,846
<i>…the classiest man on earth
for more than 15 years.</i>

47
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,396
<i>The United States loses a 
prestigious ambassador.</i>

48
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:54,746
<i>And now, a little music
with Alain Souchon.</i>

49
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,496
Oh no, not him !

50
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,173
Bitches !

51
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:59,754
— Hello boss, may I come in ?
— Come in, Dave !

52
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:04,604
I'm gonna have you on Abitbol case
with Peter and Steven

53
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,854
I like them, but why
can't I work on my own ?

54
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,904
Because you suck too bad

55
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:14,954
Well OK, you convinced me boss
I'm going to work with Peter and Steven

56
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:19,704
— So ?
— So OK, I'm going

57
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,854
This joke ? 
He still exists ?

58
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:28,604
You better get used to it,
He's going to work with you on the case

59
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:32,254
That's a brilliant idea
from our friend Callaghan

60
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:35,604
Roh, cut the crap, boss
That's Junior, that's my son

61
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:38,754
I don't know why, he got hooked on me
So I'm helping him

62
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:42,004
Maybe he had nobody else to get hooked on.
But what are we talking about ?

63
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:46,554
Where you at with George Abitbol obituary ?
You are working on it ?

64
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:52,704
— Just got into it, we have a few ideas.
— We're going to interview a bunch of people

65
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:56,854
Everyone that loved him, hated him
got close to him… that's some work already.

66
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:57,804
What else ?

67
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:01,554
We want to explain his last words

68
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:04,604
‘Shitty world’ ?
You're right.

69
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:07,154
Having this idea, it was a bitch
We were overloaded

70
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:11,404
The classiest man on earth dies,
I want to know why he said that.

71
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,654
That's not easy to find out.

72
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:19,104
If that's a woman, I want to know who she is
If that's a horse, I want to know in what race.

73
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:21,554
We were thinking about a sled.

74
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:27,504
Hello,
It's me, Orson Welles.

75
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:32,254
That's my house, here behind
Not bad, ain't it ? That's French.

76
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:36,204
Allow me to interrupt that movie
I have the feeling someone is fucking with me

77
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,454
That's theft, and plagiarism.

78
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:41,904
I don't like too much thieves
Nor sons of bitches

79
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:46,354
The hero dies and journalists
investigate his last words.

80
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:50,304
Just like in Citizen Kane.
I call that plagiarism.

81
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:57,754
The journalists will interview people
Their stories will be flashbacks.

82
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,404
I can see it coming

83
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,954
Arghhh, Rosebud !

84
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:09,804
— So, and what else ?
— We don't have the shadow of a clue

85
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:14,054
He lived in Texas half his life.
Look around there.

86
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:19,104
— Look around there… You're funny
— What enthousiasm !

87
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:24,354
Callaghan might help you. We're paying him for ages
and he doesn't give a rat's ass…

88
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:27,604
…He might as well be useful
that fat pig.

89
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:31,554
My tips, I keep them
for my son.

90
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:35,704
you have to understand me, he's my son,
my fight, my loinfruit

91
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,754
I gave him a name and an address.

92
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:40,504
— He's being a drag
— Am I wrong or you don't give a shit ?

93
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,254
Bitch.

94
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:48,704
Is it you that called me a bitch ?
That's not very nice.

95
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:55,355
Hello. I come see M. Hao.

96
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,405
— What's that ?
- Oh, go fuck yourself.

97
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,255
I go fuck myself ?
OK, I'm going.

98
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,105
What a dick !

99
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:04,755
Hello, you are looking for something ?

100
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:08,505
Oh ! Mister Hao ?
I've got mail for you.

101
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:12,655
Before you hand it to me
May I ask with whom I am speaking to?

102
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:15,105
Dave,
the son of M. Callaghan.

103
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:19,155
Let me see…
You investigate on George Abitbol.

104
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,405
Yes.
You've known him ?

105
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:27,755
I've known him back in Texas
When he was still a cowboy.

106
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:31,705
I was also a cowboy. I lived
with my good friend Jacques

107
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:34,855
Nothing sexual between us.

108
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:38,648
I'm telling you this because often
I've been called a fag, a queer…

109
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,398
It's easy calling people faggots…

110
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:46,648
<i>…all that because two guys live together 
in a ranch and wear leather pants.</i>

111
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:49,098
<i>Someday, a mail came in.</i>

112
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:52,448
Hey faggots, there's mail for you !
Here. Have a good fuck !

113
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,898
Dumbass !

114
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:07,338
<i>- What was in that mail ?
— I don't know, it was for Jacques.</i>

115
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:10,988
<i>So tell me something you know about,
for a change!</i>

116
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:15,038
<i>OK. After that we left for
George's town.</i>

117
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,088
I'm sick of it. Traveling on a horse
exhausts me.

118
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,138
What's wrong with you ?

119
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:30,488
Oh I'm getting tired of travelling.
I dream of a good bath in a good inn.

120
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,138
I swear
I have the blueballs

121
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:41,929
Yep.

122
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,824
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

123
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:50,774
— Why do you say ‘Yep’ ?
— It's for saying ‘Yep’.

124
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,624
That's quite unusual

125
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:58,674
— Watch out ! The chef's specialty
— It looks super good !

126
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:02,624
And now you are going to tell me
why we're here ?

127
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:06,374
A mysterious mail comes in
and here we arrive running ?

128
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:10,324
— What was in it ?
— It was an epistolary mail from Dino.

129
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:14,374
He's crying for help to rescue George.

130
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:18,824
Why do you give a fuck about that moron ?
I never could stand him.

131
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:24,374
Thanks for calling me moron
It's always pleasant…

132
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:28,824
…especially from two faggots.
Do you know what you are eating, here ?

133
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:32,874
Steaks with meatballs from between 
the fingernails. It's good !

134
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,924
That's very nice
Thank you !

135
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:40,374
— The sauce, it's dried snot
— Shut-up, you're going to disgust them

136
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:46,624
Mind you own business. The boss, Ms. Felipe,
she slice her knockers to make ravioli.

137
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:50,122
— That's disgusting, shit !
— Wait, if he's the classiest  man…

138
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,972
…he will certainly apologize !

139
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:56,022
My apologies, you can stick them up your ass,
just as your steak.

140
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,072
Except that for the steak, the boss already did so.
And he spitted on it.

141
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:01,922
Ah no ! The boss doesn't spit
in the meals !

142
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:05,772
Even in fancy restaurants people
spit in meals…

143
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:08,622
…so in this dump,
why would they give a shit ?

144
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:10,872
I let you eat now.
Bon appétit !

145
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:14,722
I've known a republican,
he had 10 times more class

146
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:24,646
Ah, just one more thing
Try to avoid the boss's chocolate mousse

147
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,996
And then ?
Breath deeply.

148
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:35,446
Then, I had an accident.
I got wounded

149
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,596
I had amnesia,
I could not remember a thing.

150
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:42,046
You know other things about Georges ?

151
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:47,896
I don't eat ravioli any more.
But I can talk about Ms. Felipe.

152
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:52,646
She had a boob job
And I know what I'm talking about !

153
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,196
<i>And George ?</i>

154
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,246
<i>Right, once at the bilinguals
native americans…</i>

155
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,996
— Hello, Hao
— Salut.

156
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:04,846
Hi Hao,
Hao, Hi !

157
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:07,596
Hello guys !
I'm happy to see you.

158
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:13,246
I though I could stay a while
except if you want me … to leave ?

159
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:20,096
You can stay, no problem
I'm even happy you came here

160
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:24,246
I wish you can stay.
We'll eat… chips !

161
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:29,696
Do you read me ? Chips ! Is that all you feel 
when I say we'll eat chips?

162
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:35,746
What's wrong with you ? You're silent.
Are you sulking me or what ?

163
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:38,096
You remind me of George,
politically.

164
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:42,746
George ?
I don't have anything to do with George !

165
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,996
Because if we think about it,
I'm a real democrat.

166
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:50,346
George is a fascist turd, you hear me ?
A fascist turd !

167
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:55,896
It's true.
My bad.

168
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,646
And what happened to that
indian chief ?

169
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:04,296
After that he was a vigilante in town
but now he's done showing off

170
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:08,046
We found him murdered one day.
He died from it.

171
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:12,896
— Is that the number from your friend Jascques ?
— Yes

172
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:16,346
I''m going to hand it over my colleagues
we have to interrogate him

173
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:21,896
Allo Peter ? Take a sheet
We have to interview a certain Jacques

174
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:27,846
So his number is 19 94 0 18 13…

175
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:32,341
…24 32 49 26 24…

176
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:36,245
…40 4 16 70933…

177
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:42,146
— …16 minus 4, watch out there's a trap
— OK, so we call him

178
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,496
Ok, so we get back in touch

179
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:58,124
Hello, you've reached Steven.
Leave a message at the tone.

180
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:02,074
I got a call from Date.
Here, Jacques's numner

181
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:07,624
That's Jacques's number,
I found it at the archives.

182
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:10,774
Dave's number
That's bullshit.

183
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,624
He's bugging me, Dave.

184
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:15,774
What's bugging me
It's lame special effects

185
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,124
Like he's a special effects pro

186
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:21,474
Ah but anytime. Here, the special
effect of the ringbell : dring dring !

187
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:25,224
- Very impressive.
— Dring dring !

188
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:29,674
— Damn, I'm impressed.
— A last dring and you call Jacques !

189
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:35,024
— Allo, Mister Jacques ?
— Absolutely.

190
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,774
I work on George Abitbol case, and I
would like your testimony

191
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:41,424
It's good !

192
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:48,474
No offense, but I don't have 
too much time

193
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:53,524
I can make an effort for George Abitbol,
but I am no sucker

194
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:58,374
Thank you, you are very nice.
Note that I said nice, not homosexual

195
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:03,224
Because Hao told us you
went to George's town…

196
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:06,674
— …after you've receive just a letter.
— Absolutely.

197
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:11,724
You are referring to this missive
That had been bestowed upon us, Hao and I

198
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:15,474
<i>It looked urgend,
looking after the hast of the rider.</i>

199
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:21,024
<i>The sender has wrote on the back
« pick up pace for that friendship cannot wait ».</i>

200
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:25,874
<i>The letter was from a friend, Dino,
Who asked to come after and help him.</i>

201
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:30,324
<i>In a nutshell,
We set off promptly.</i>

202
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:34,074
— I'm sick of it !
— You're boring…

203
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,824
— …what is it now ?
— I'm hungry.

204
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:42,974
Listen, just a few more kilometers
and we'll be at a good inn.

205
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:47,724
What a spoilsport.

206
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:53,774
Yep. Yep.

207
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:58,124
I'm interrupting, please excuse me,
but Hao already told us this episode

208
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:03,174
What happened to you after this meal
In the good inn ?

209
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:05,524
Absolutely.

210
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:10,774
After lunch it was time
to have some work done. J’allâme voir Dino. FIXME

211
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:20,624
Dino, my poor friend
You don't look too well.

212
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:26,374
Why did you put yourself
In this pitiful condition ?

213
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:29,024
You who write
such beautiful letters !

214
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:34,874
It's getting real bad.
I don't feel like drinking or eating anymore.

215
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,424
I don't feel like brushing my hair anymore.

216
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:41,474
I am almost
nervous breakdown.

217
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:45,224
And fuck it!
I don't feel like washing myself anymore.

218
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:48,474
It is not because of Georges,
is it?

219
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:54,024
You cannot imagine.
He's become unbearable.

220
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:57,374
This is not a reason for
not washing your cheeks anymore.

221
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:00,924
— You gotta quit!
— What I'm quitting, it's label pins, pal.

222
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,174
It doesn't make me laugh anymore.

223
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:06,224
You're looking pitiful right now, you know.

224
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:11,074
Cause if it makes you quit your collection...
Would you mind if I look at your label pin?

225
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:14,824
Sheraf ? Don't know it.

226
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:21,174
I do have a collection too, for a long time.
And it's not a fagot collection!

227
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:24,924
Except that Sheraf, dunno.
Inconnu au bataillon.
# TODO: ask native speaker

228
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:28,174
You don't know Sheraf?

229
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,724
It's a band, they were number one.

230
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:34,774
It's not a reason to slack off
and look like a larva.

231
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:41,724
Watch out! I've fucked my hands with
with that fucking rubbish collection!

232
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:45,774
I'm taking off, thanks for the label pins!
Don't you worry, it's gonna be alright.

233
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,524
— As we say, Lehaïm !
— Lehaïm.

234
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:54,974
Good evening !

235
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,124
Fagot.

236
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:03,674
It's not banal.

237
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:10,524
It's getting cumbersome, this whole fagot thing.
Tout le monde s’acharne sur nous…

— Yes I know.

Don't worry, as soon as tomorrow
I'm gonna see George.

240
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:24,074
Ok, good night. Sleep well.

241
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:36,471
George, I have to talk to you.
Just because I'm nice…

242
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:41,121
…people take me for a dumbass.
Right. But I think we need to talk.

243
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,371
— You are not going well. Let me help you.
— Fuck off, Jacques !

244
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:47,221
You refuse the dialog?

245
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:52,471
Exactly, I don't wanna talk.
I want you to leave the town before nine.

246
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:56,721
Reassure me, you wouldn't be 
taking me for a fool?

247
00:18:56,971 --> 00:19:00,471
Yes I do, completly even.
And get the fuck out now.

248
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:05,421
You are desapointing me, I was expecting
more open-mindedness.

249
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,671
I will help you in spite of yourself!

250
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:14,321
To stay in town in spite of George threats,
it's pretty brave for a fagot like you.

251
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:19,571
Is it over, that rumor, yes?
I've never been homosexual nor pederast.

252
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,521
It's amazing you have so much hang-ups.

253

— Confess, you're nabbing shame.

Wearing a thong you must be hot.

Be ready.
It's nearly time.

257
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:47,681
Cigarette?

258
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,271
Alright, I will
tell you everything, since…

259
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:03,121
Oh! It's nine.

260
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,346
It's already nine, now?

On my forehead

Apart from that, you are classy!

263
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,396
You will see, the class.

264
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,546
Fucking zeb, nardin!

265
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:45,096
Where is human madness driving us?
We are running straight to our loss.

— Boss, I got dynamite!
— It gives me an idea.

Eh loosers, I'm not the only fagot!
There's another one and he's called George!

268
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:57,246
That's it, talk, talk.

269
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:58,696
Bastard!

00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:00,846
And you, filthy parasite!
Fuck off!

— Ah bon ?
— Absolument.

278
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:28,322
Hugues fut gravement blessé.
George s’est immédiatement excusé.

279
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:31,772
— George, s’excuser ? Immédiatement ?
— Absolument.

280
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:34,022
— Quelle classe.
— Absolument.

Hugues, j’ai su que tu étais blessé.
Je suis venu m’excuser.

282
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:44,722
Il fallait y penser avant, au lieu de
venir pleurer dans ma chambre.

283
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,472
C'est vrai, cest minable.
C’est tout moi, ça.

284
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:54,522
Mais j’espérais quand même
te faire plaisir.

285
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,272
Mon plus grand plaisir serait
que tu te calmes, gros blaireau.

286
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:03,722
Eh oui.
Je m’énerve.

287
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,776
Ah ben donc si je résume,
George n’a eu à vous faire qu’un mea culpa.

288
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,424
<i>Vous êtes drôlement gentil, vous.</i>

289
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:12,504
Arrêtez de dire ça.

290
00:22:12,754 --> 00:22:13,600
Je ne suis pas gentil, c'est pas vrai.

291
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,832
Quand je m'énerve je me mets dans des
états dingues, je suis méconnaissable.

292
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,464
<i>OK, excusez moi, je peux vous
poser une dernière question ?</i>

293
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,160
Absolument.

294
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:23,500
<i>À quoi vous pensez si je vous dit
« monde de merde » ?</i>

295
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,500
Au revoir.

296
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,250
Pourquoi tu as choisi de
faire ce boulot-là, toi ?

297
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,900
Si je fais journaliste c’est
évidemment pour être célèbre.

298
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:31,250
Moi je veux être connu.
Tu sais pourquoi ?

299
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,000
Pour niquer les gonzesses.

300
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,510
Quand tu es célèbre,
tu niques plein de gonzesses.

301
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,960
Et puis aussi tu bouffes
des trucs bien meilleurs qu’ici.

302
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,710
Et moi pour les gonzesses
je suis super d’accord avec toi.

303
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,200
Mais pour la bouffe
je vois pas ce que tu veux dire.

304
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:46,250
Tu aurais envie de
manger quoi exactement ?

305
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,900
Ben je sais pas,
par exemple une quiche lorraine.

306
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,900
Une ouiche.

307
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:51,400
Quoi ?

308
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
On dit « une ouiche lorraine ».

309
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,100
Tu es sûr ?

310
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,884
Ça fait bizarre, « ouiche lorraine ».

311
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,686
On va où, là ?

312
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,072
On va voir Dino, le mec
qui a écrit la lettre à Jacques.

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,496
Ouais.

315
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
Qu’est-ce que tu disais, là ?

316
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,400
Rien, des conneries.
Laisse tomber.

317
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:15,563
Je sais pas toi,
mais moi le mystère s’épaissit.

318
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:19,000
Messieurs, permettez-moi
de vous souhaiter la bienvenue.

319
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,640
D'ailleurs, il faut pas rester debout,
asseyez-vous, mettez-vous à l’aise.

320
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,473
Merci Monsieur, c’est très gentil.

321
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,041
C’est une leçon de savoir-vivre.

322
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,866
C’est naturel.

323
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:30,485
Mais dites-moi plutôt
ce que je peux faire.

324
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:34,052
Nous sommes journalistes. Nous
voudrions savoir où vous avez connu…

325
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,817
— George Abitbol !
— Ah oui. George Abitbol.

326
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,597
Où j’ai connu George ?

327
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,405
C’est une excellente question. À la ferme.

328
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,669
La ferme ? Quelle ferme ?

329
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:47,161
Ah la ferme ta gueule toi,
ducon, espèce de crétin.

330
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,146
Qu’est-ce que tu veux,
nous prendre la tête, là ? Pauvre con.

331
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,249
Oui je l’ai connu à la ferme.
On était des cowboys.

332
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,898
On vivait à la ferme,
ça a rien d’étonnant.

333
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:55,873
Merci, c’est très agréable.

334
00:23:55,906 --> 00:24:00,571
Non mais c’est vrai, je me fais engueuler
devant des journalistes qu’on connaît même pas.

335
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:01,935
C’est classe, bravo.

336
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:04,451
Oh ça va, on vous fait pas chier, là ?
Non c’est sûr. Non mais je rêve.

337
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:09,351
Dites-moi, vous avez envoyé une lettre
à Jacques. C’était quoi, cette lettre ?

338
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:12,950
Eh bien, cette lettre,
c’est vraiment très simple.

339
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:16,446
J’avais un problème avec George.
J’ai écrit à mon vieil ami Jacques.

340
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:19,487
Mais si vous le voulez bien,
je vais tout vous raconter depuis le début.

341
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,669
J’arrivais d’Italie, de Turin.
J’étais supporter de la Juventus.

342
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:36,150
OK, j’arrive !
Arrête de tirer sur oim.

343
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,666
Mouais.

344
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:38,776
Viens ici.

345
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:44,406
Qu’est-ce que tu fous avec les bras en l’air ?
Je t’ai dit de les lever ?

346
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,518
Baisse tes bras,
c’est moi qui les lève.

347
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,103
Ah non,
c’est à moi de les lever.

348
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,082
Non, c’est à moi de les lever.
C’est moi qui décide.

349
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,645
Et puis d’ailleurs,
arrête de faire tout comme moi.

350
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:55,569
Baisse les bras et prends ton flingue,
au lieu d’être là à me copier.

351
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:57,563
Mon flingue ? Avec plaisir.

352
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:02,857
Tout compte fait, je préfère
garder mon flingue. Désolé.

353
00:25:04,048 --> 00:25:06,727
Et je vais partir
avec mon cheval, vieux.

354
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,715
Pas de problème, comme tu veux.
Je vais juste le préparer pour toi.

355
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,314
Non, j’ai changé d’avis.
Tu prends le cheval et tu te casses.

356
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,645
OK.

357
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:22,267
Putain je me suis mal démerdé !
Pourtant, j’ai pas fait une concession !

358
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:26,396
Le temps a passé…
Je pensais ne plus jamais revoir ce type.

359
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,306
Mais un an après, nos chemins
se sont croisés une nouvelle fois.

360
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,433
Je fréquentais alors un bar que le patron,
un certain Bazounga…

361
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,912
avait intelligemment baptisé
le Orlando’s.

362
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:38,698
Mais je te reconnais, toi.
Je t’ai déjà vu quelque part.
Je suis sûr que je te reconnais.

363
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,120
Désolé, mais c’est moi qui te reconnais.
Je t’ai vu le premier.
Toi tu m’as vu en deuxième, vu ?

364
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,115
Ben je t’ai vu le deuxième alors, voilà.

365
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:49,501
Perdu !
C’est aussi moi qui t’ai vu le deuxième.

366
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:52,012
Oh dis donc, tu es super fort.

367
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:54,993
Je suis pas super fort,
je suis mieux que ça, même,
je suis surpuissant.

368
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,698
Bon, lui, il va
me prendre la tête.

369
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:05,720
Ça fait plusieurs fois que je te croise.
Tu es toujours sur mon chemin, tu veux quoi ?

370
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:08,204
Mais c’est peut-être toi qui es sur mon chemin, pas moi.

371
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,078
C’est pas mal, ça, le pin’s sur la cravate.

372
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,788
C’est la classe.

373
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:14,775
Mais au fait, toi,
d’où tu viens ?

374
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:16,450
Moi, je suis juif.

375
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:17,929
Tu es juif, toi ?

376
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:23,213
Oh oui je suis juif. Et si tu veux
tout savoir, je suis même juif arabe.

377
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,284
Juif arabe ? Tu sais,
je préfère les séfarades.

378
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,019
À mon avis, juif et arabe,
c’est bizarre.

379
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,445
Moi j’aime pas les gens bizarres.

380
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:39,578
Merde, je peux pas encadrer les nazis.
Mais laisse tomber.

381
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:41,816
Précise ta pensée ?

382
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,024
— Pour être tout à fait exact…
— Oui ?

383
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:46,865
Je pense que tu es un ouf, toi.
Un ouf malade.

384
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,059
En plus, c’est du racisme.

385
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:53,362
C’est ton opinion personnelle,
que je suis raciste.

386
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:58,081
À mon avis, s’il y a
un raciste ici, c’est oit.

387
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:00,977
Ça sert à rien de discuter avec toi,
tu as toujours raison.

388
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:04,045
Si, ça sert de discuter.
C’est toi qui as toujours raison.

389
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,927
Qu’est-ce que j’apprends, Frankie ?
Espèce de malhonnête.

390
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:12,717
Il paraît que tu as des propos
intolérables, où il y a pas de tolérance ?

391
00:27:13,392 --> 00:27:16,807
Tu sais donc pas que c’est pas bien,
d’être raciste ? Que c’est mal ?

392
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:19,698
Qu’on ne doit pas faire de
discrimination raciale, c’est mal.

393
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,830
Juger les gens sur leur religion, c’est mal.
Sur leur couleur de peau…

394
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,557
… sur leurs origines sociales ou
leur nationalité, c’est mal.

395
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:31,876
OK, puisqu’on peut pas discuter,
on va faire un duel.

396
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,582
Enculé de ta race !

397
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:46,349
J’adore les duels inoffensifs.

398
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:49,510
Et maintenant, casse-toi.

399
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:54,707
La prochaine fois, je m’occuperai
de toi avec de vraies balles.

400
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,794
Et ça chauffera pour ton cul.
Sale Français !

401
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:02,787
Oh, je suis même pas Français.
Je suis Américain.

402
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:04,834
Non, tu es Français.
Moi, je suis Américain !

403
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:08,028
Et voilà, c’est pour ça que je l’ai
appelé mon vieil ami Jacques.

404
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,441
Je veux pas dire, mais c’est un mec
qui a vraiment plein de qualités.

405
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:14,765
Je me demande quand même
s’il était pas un peu con.

406
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,553
Parlez-nous du contenu
de cette lettre.

407
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:21,304
Oui s’il vous plaît. À moins que ça soit
privé et que vous ayez des principes.

408
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,401
Mais c’est privé,
et j’ai des principes.

409
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:28,789
Mais vous m’êtes sympathiques,
je vais vous raconter.

410
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,801
Merci, c’est gentil à vous.

411
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:32,401
Il y a pas de mal,
vous m’êtes sympathiques.

412
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:35,136
C’était un soir.
J’avais le spleen, le blues.

413
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,730
Mon cher Jacques, je vous écris
parce que j’ai besoin de vous.

414
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,845
C’est George qui a besoin d’aide.
Il ne supporte plus la vie au Texas.

415
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,674
Pas de clim’, pas de téléphone,
pas de télé, pas de chauffage…

416
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,086
Bref, il supporte mal de ne pas avoir
une vie moderne. Ça le rend irritable.

417
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:52,981
Hier…

418
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,537
Bonsoir George, j’aimerais
beaucoup vous parler.

419
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,643
Si tu veux me parler,
envoie-moi un… fax !

420
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,345
Un fax, non mais des fois.
Faut vraiment qu’il aille mal.

421
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:07,370
Avant c’était pas comme ça.

422
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:12,761
Avec George, on passait
des après-midi dans notre chambre…

423
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,355
… à se chamailler gentiment,
à se raconter des souvenirs…

424
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:17,558
Tu veux que je te raconte
un souvenir ?

425
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:19,773
Un souvenir ? Oh oui.

426
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,796
Laisse tomber,
tu te fous de ma gueule ?

427
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,614
Oh non je me fous pas de
votre gueule, jamais de la vie.

428
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:29,546
Je vais te raconter l’histoire de ce malade
qui s’est pointé un soir dans ma chambre.

429
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,650
Un putain d’énergumène.

430
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:34,847
Bonsoir. Qu’est-ce que vous faites
dans ma chambre ?

431
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:38,657
Vous avez un truc
à me demander ?

432
00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:42,179
Aime-moi tendre,
aime-moi vrai.

433
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,728
Ça veut dire quoi
ces conneries ?

434
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:47,321
Ça veut dire aime-moi tendre
et aime-moi vrai.

435
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:50,364
Ce que je vois, c’est que je vais
te botter le cul dans deux secondes.

436
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,706
Écoute, tu peux faire
tout ce que tu veux…

437
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:54,201
… mais ne marche pas sur mes
chaussures en suédine bleue.

438
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:58,568
C’est quoi ça ?

439
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:00,611
Ne sois pas cruel.

440
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,261
Un pour l’argent.

441
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,605
Deux pour le spectacle.

442
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:08,655
Et trois pour le caillou.

443
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:10,555
Et voilà, c’était mon souvenir.

444
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:14,856
S’il cherchait pour du trouble,
il est venu à la bonne place.

445
00:30:15,308 --> 00:30:18,307
Voilà. Malheureusement,
aujourd’hui c’est bien fini.

446
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:20,124
George n’est plus le même homme.

447
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:22,163
C’est pourquoi vous devez venir,
mon cher Jacques.

448
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:28,848
Je pense que vous voyez mieux
le problème que j’avais avec George…

449
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,544
et pourquoi j’ai écrit cette lettre.

450
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,792
Tu peux me dire ce qu’on fait
dans ce flim, Bob ?

451
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,511
Oui je pourrais,
mais d’abord faut sucer.

452
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,150
Je plaisantais, détends-toi.
On a rien à faire là.

453
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:46,617
Ça doit être une erreur dans
l’enchaînement des flashbacks.

454
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:48,632
Ça devrait pas trop durer.

455
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,744
Ça m’a l’air d’un bordel…

456
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,462
Attention, on tourne à droite.
Un, deux, trois.

457
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:58,867
Restabilisation.

458
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:04,015
Attention, on va plonger.

459
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:10,209
Immersion de l’astronef.

460
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:15,310
J’ai un de ces mals de bide, moi.
Ça c’est le hamburger, ça.

461
00:31:15,662 --> 00:31:18,755
J’arrive pas à le digérer. Tu avais raison,
on aurait dû prendre une ouiche lorraine.

462
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,464
Je suis sûr qu’on dit « quiche ».

463
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:23,117
M’emmerde pas avec tes histoires,
je te dis que j’ai mal au bide.

464
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:24,682
J’ai la méga chiasse,
putain, la méga chiasse !

465
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:25,544
Excuse-moi !

466
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,385
Excuse-moi, mal au bide,
tu sais ce que c’est ?

467
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:29,967
Faut que j’aille chier, bordel…
faut que j’aille chier rapidos !

468
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:34,974
Alors une, tu poses mon bouquin
d’exercices isométriques.

469
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:36,221
Merci.

470
00:31:36,246 --> 00:31:38,946
Et deux, on pourrait savoir
ce que tu fais dans mon bureau ?

471
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,738
Rien. À part que j’ai une
information qui mérite la une.

472
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:47,253
La mort de George
n’était pas accidentelle.

473
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,687
Il s’est fait assassiner.

474
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,553
Et comment tu sais ça ?

475
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:54,244
C’est très simple, j’ai eu le tuyau
par un dénommé Gorge Profonde.

476
00:31:54,356 --> 00:31:57,547
Merde alors, Gorge Profonde ?
Mais c’est incroyable, ça.

477
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:01,425
Maintenant de toute façon
j’ai fait avancer l’enquête.

478
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:04,075
Et on peut savoir,
ça veut dire quoi ça ?

479
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:08,012
Rien. À part que toi et ton copain Peter
vous êtes un peu à la rue.

480
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,451
Mais t’es un minable ! Tu te crois
le meilleur journaliste du monde ?

481
00:32:11,488 --> 00:32:12,785
Mais c’est incroyable, ça.

482
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,710
<i>« Meilleur journaliste du monde,
incroyable ça ! »</i>

483
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,491
Bon maintenant tu arrêtes !

484
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:19,240
Pendant qu’on parle,
Peter il a la méga chiasse.

485
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,248
Alors un peu de dignité !

486
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:24,402
Et je voulais te dire un truc
à propos de Gorge Profonde.

487
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,367
C’est mon indicateur !
Alors, touche à ton cul.

488
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:29,694
Excusez-moi, Messieurs.

489
00:32:29,732 --> 00:32:31,330
Peter il fait du boucan
dans les waters.

490
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:40,056
Steven !

491
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,730
Tu vas pas me croire.
J’ai plus mal au bide. Je suis guéri.

492
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:48,428
Par contre, on ne peut plus rentrer
dans les chiottes, il y en a partout.

493
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:49,853
Merde, allez !

494
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,890
Patron !

495
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
On a un problème,
faut qu’on vous parle.

496
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:03,345
Du dossier George Abitbol ?

497
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,453
Non, des chiottes.
Peter les a bouchées.

498
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,444
Ce n’est pas ma faute.

499
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:08,695
J’étais malade.

500
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:11,144
Ça doit être les burgers.

501
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:16,572
Allô, Peter ? C’est Steven.

502
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,769
Note bien ce que je vais te dire.
Tu vas interroger un certain José.

503
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:24,221
Noter… Dire… Interroger. José.

504
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,971
Par contre, il supporte pas les journalistes.
C’est bon, là, tu notes, là ?

505
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:29,183
Ben oui, je note.

506
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:34,124
S’il sait que tu es journaliste,
il te recevra pas.

507
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:37,386
S’il sait…
journaliste… pas.

508
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:39,694
Ce que tu vas faire,
c’est que tu vas te déguiser.

509
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:41,978
Ce que je vais faire…
déguiser.

510
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:42,800
Tu as tout compris ?

511
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,719
Oui. Mais mon téléphone
il marche pas.

512
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:45,740
Et, tu vas te déguiser comment ?

513
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,603
Je sais pas encore.

514
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,870
Tu as intérêt à trouver un truc bien.
Je te fais confiance.

515
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,440
T’inquiète !
Je vais trouver un truc bien.

516
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,208
Un restaurant mexican food.
Zeb ! C’est pas vrai.

517
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:12,771
Buenas noches.

518
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:13,800
Mais tu parles espagnol ?

519
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,100
Un poquito.

520
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:17,011
Tu crois que tu m’impressionnes ?

521
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,808
Je sais dire « allons à la plage,
monsieur renard ».

522
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:20,193
<i>Vamos a la playa, señor zorro.</i>

523
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,697
Tu aimerais te bâfrer
un chili con carne ?

524
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,672
Non, merci.
Je suis un peu ballonné.

525
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,346
Je suis pas trop bien.

526
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:32,943
Désolé. Il y a pas d’offense ?

527
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,133
La prochaine fois, avec plaisir.

528
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:40,037
Un bon chili con carne,
d’habitude, je suis partant.

529
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:48,358
Mais là, je fais un régime,
à base de ouiches lorraines.

530
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:53,157
Excuse-moi, à base ?

531
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:55,689
À base de ouiches lorraines.
C’est des petites tartes.

532
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,244
Mais pour qui tu me prends,
je rêve !

533
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:01,464
La fromagerie en bas de chez moi,
elle vendait trois choses.

534
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,855
Du fromage, des ouiches lorraines
et de la bouffe chinoise.

535
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:06,709
Alors avec tes régimes à la con,
tu me fais bien marrer.

536
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:10,660
Tu as devant toi le spécialiste
de la ouiche lorraine.

537
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,777
Le spécialiste des travers
de porc sel-poivre.

538
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:19,713
À 23 ans j’ai gagné le concours
du meilleur cuisinier asiatique…

539
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:22,142
en leur préparant un méchoui.

540
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:25,590
Un méchoui ?
Tu pipeautes pas un peu ?

541
00:35:25,736 --> 00:35:26,732
Jamais je pipeaute.

542
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:29,373
Puisque c’est ça,
parle-moi de George Abitbol.

543
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:31,832
C’était loin d’être un pérave.

544
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:35,682
Jamais il se serait vanté
comme moi sur la cuisine.

545
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:37,293
Humainement, il avait la classe.

546
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,503
Je préfèrerais avoir sa classe
plutôt que la mienne.

547
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:41,784
Moi je suis un peu just.

548
00:35:42,111 --> 00:35:43,208
Vous l’aimiez bien.

549
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:44,087
Ouais.

550
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:45,912
Laissez-moi.

551
00:35:47,503 --> 00:35:50,210
Eh, la choucroute !
Si tu veux une saucisse…

552
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,406
C’est trop bien de se déguiser.

553
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:03,688
Mouais.

554
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,918
Non non, je t’assure.

555
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:11,381
Abitbol. George Abitbol.

556
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:15,633
Classe, man ! Top of the pop.

557
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:21,267
A disparu… poil au cul !

558
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,522
Au large du port de Valparaiso…

559
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:28,191
Ah, c’est beau !

560
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:32,341
Mais tout ça
nous éloigne de George.

561
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,350
Angoisse, fausse angoisse.

562
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,559
J’ai plus de repères pour l’instant…

563
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:56,143
Steven, arrête, j’ai jamais pu
encadrer Michel Legrand.

564
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:58,394
D’accord, d’accord.

565
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:05,940
J’aime pas comme tu conduis,
je sais pas, j’ai pas confiance.

566
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:10,241
Tais-toi, tu m’empêches
de me concentrer.

567
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:15,728
Quand je serai célèbre,
je me ferai des meufs !

568
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,269
Je ferai des folies !

569
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,700
Steven, arrête-toi
c’est insupportable.

570
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,196
Tu sais, à propos de Steven…

571
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,329
… c’est encore plus balaise
que mon déguisement.

572
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,950
Il traverse tout le pays
pour une interview.

573
00:37:44,882 --> 00:37:47,779
Mais lui, il se met vraiment
dans la peau du personnage.

574
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,675
Je trouve ça vraiment courageux
de traverser l’Amérique. À pied.

575
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:56,113
C’est du journalisme total.

576
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,725
Il passe par l’Alaska, ce con !

577
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:02,495
Monter à pied là-haut,
putain faut être con !

578
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:07,928
Tu vois, au début je trouvais
ça con de se déguiser.

579
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:11,407
Mais vous m’avez donné envie.
Sauf qu'on va pas me reconnaître.

580
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,695
C’est comme ça.
Un vrai petit caméléon le Dave.

581
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:18,834
Tu trouves pas que je me suis
musclé ces derniers temps ?

582
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:20,547
Tu veux voir mon déguisement ?

583
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:25,017
Tu sais, faut le voir porté.

584
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,897
Tu as déjà entendu parler
d’Artemus Gordon ?

585
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,642
Tu peux faire beaucoup mieux
qu’une simple chemise.

586
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:34,094
Ça c’est à peine croyable.

587
00:38:34,722 --> 00:38:37,328
Je me trouve une panoplie super bien.

588
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:43,293
Une chemise dont je suis hyper fier,
et voilà comment on le félicite, le Dave.

589
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,408
Excuse-moi, mais là je pense à Steven.

590
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:52,728
Il a beau être à pied, il doit sûrement
vivre des moments extraordinaires.

591
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:55,178
<i>Mon cher Peter, ça y est, j’y suis.</i>

592
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,967
<i>Mais mon déguisement
n’est pas tout à fait fini.</i>

593
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:00,482
La casquette et les bottes
ne me conviennent qu’à moitié.

594
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,307
Je sens grandir la flamme qui a dû
animer les grands reporters de ce siècle.

595
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:09,061
Je pense à Albert Londres,
Gunter Wallraff, Robert Namias.

596
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:10,690
Entrez !

597
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:18,124
Bonjour, je suis journaliste et j'enquête
sur la mort de George Abitbol.

598
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:20,988
Vous avez vécu au Texas.
Je voudrais recueillir votre témoignage.

599
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,764
Je vous arrête tout de suite.

600
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,907
Il y a erreur, je n’ai jamais
mis les pieds au Texas.

601
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:28,610
Laissez tomber votre cinéma,
je sais que vous y étiez.

602
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:29,639
OK, c'est bon.

603
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,686
Mais je dois vous dire, je ne me
souviens plus de grand-chose.

604
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,084
À vrai dire, j’ai quelques
souvenirs très confus.

605
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,883
Des visages qui me reviennent
de temps à autre.

606
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,998
Je me souviens surtout d’odeurs.

607
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,992
De sensations, plus que
d’anecdotes précises.

608
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,768
D’autant que je ne suis pas
resté longtemps au Texas.

609
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,673
En fait, je ne vois pas
ce que je pourrais vous raconter.

610
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,557
Sinon deux ou trois vagues choses
sans intérêt pour un journaliste.

611
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,280
Alors une, je ne m’en souviens pas.

612
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,091
Deux, je ne suis pas resté longtemps.

613
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,091
Et enfin cinq… il y a pas de cinq.

614
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,744
Si vous ne voulez pas m’aider,
allez vous faire enculer.

615
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:06,054
<i>Mon cher Peter, me voici en Alaska.</i>

616
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,269
<i>Malgré le froid,
malgré une mule impotente.</i>

617
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,900
<i>Malgré ma fausse barbe qui me gratte.</i>

618
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,655
<i>Je continue à croire en mon aventure.</i>

619
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,056
<i>J’ai quand même
deux ou trois doutes.</i>

620
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,978
Tu vois, il commence à ressembler
à quelque chose, ton déguisement.

621
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,119
Mais avec ta tête de Français,
vraiment je suis pas sûr.

622
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:24,884
Tu as du boulot avant de faire
comme Steven. C’est le meilleur.

623
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:30,046
Je vais métamorphoser ma tête de
Français, tu vas pas en croire tes yeux.

624
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:32,795
Moi aussi je vais au Texas,
récolter des témoignages.

625
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,073
Mais je suis pas comme Steven,
je prends l’avion.

626
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,859
<i>Mon cher Peter, j’ai perdu
beaucoup de temps avec le blizzard.</i>

627
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,844
<i>Je crois bien que j’ai pris froid.</i>

628
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:51,112
Alors les bouseux,
qui va me parler de George ?

629
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,501
Qui c’est qui va tout dire à Dave ?

630
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:56,400
Toi tu dis rien, c’est normal,
tu es une croix en bois.

631
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,374
Tu n’as qu’à te taire.

632
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:02,393
Voilà enfin quelqu’un qui pourra
me dire quelque chose !

633
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,669
Tu veux pas me parler ?

634
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,816
Tu veux que je fasse
parler la poudre ?

635
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,695
À mon avis, tu me
prends pour un con.

636
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,452
Tu m’as l’air bien jeune pour
avoir connu cette époque.

637
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:39,126
Une vachette comme toi,
ça sent le pipeau ton histoire.

638
00:41:39,732 --> 00:41:40,629
Le pipeau !

639
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,484
<i>Mon cher Peter,
me voilà dans le désert.</i>

640
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:47,350
<i>J’ai un nouvel ami. Il me suit partout,
mais il est un peu con.</i>

641
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,460
<i>Tu me diras, il a cinq ans.</i>

642
00:41:50,554 --> 00:41:51,954
<i>Je me sens seul…</i>

643
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:54,732
Écoutez, on m’a dit que vous
étiez fiancée à George.

644
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,008
C’est ce qu’il voulait faire croire.

645
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,843
Et il y est arrivé.

646
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,222
Vous me dites qu’il a menti ?
Vous le traitez de menteur ?

647
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,752
Oui, un menteur hors pair,
et avec bien d’autres défauts.

648
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,023
Il était amoureux de moi.

649
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:13,218
Mais il était lourd, et collant.

650
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,792
Bien sûr aujourd’hui,
j’ai des regrets.

651
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,937
J’aurais peut-être dû agir autrement,
mais c’était impossible.

652
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,630
Aucune femme n’aurait voulu
de lui à cette époque.

653
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,330
Il était trop balourd, trop pataud.

654
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:30,122
Il voulait pas
me lâcher la touffe.

655
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,824
Bonjour Madame.

656
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:38,254
Je voulais vous dire,
je vous aime.

657
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:40,703
On va le savoir, vous arrêtez
pas de me le répéter.

658
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:44,721
Vous savez bien que
je ne vous aime pas, George.

659
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:45,931
Oui, je sais bien.

660
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:47,737
Alors, qu’est-ce que vous voulez ?

661
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:50,007
J’aime vos seins. Vos loches.

662
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,757
Les bras m’en tombent.

663
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:54,214
Vous me trouvez pas désirable ?

664
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,711
C’est pas ça, George.

665
00:42:59,273 --> 00:43:01,073
C’est pas que vous
êtes pas désirable.

666
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:04,754
Mais avec les femmes,
vous manquez de tact. En gros.

667
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,754
Ils sont crado, vos verres.

668
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:10,201
Et alors ?
Je suis pas votre bonne !

669
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:14,526
N’empêche qu’une fois
que les choses réblblbl…

670
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:15,474
George !

671
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,354
Je vous ai déjà dit de
ne pas parler en buvant.

672
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,767
C’est mauvais pour l’estomac.

673
00:43:26,785 --> 00:43:28,311
Excusez-moi Madame.

674
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:38,310
Je pense qu’il avait pas plus
de classe que de beurre au cul.

675
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:39,616
J’ai jamais compris
comment il a eu le titre.

676
00:43:40,423 --> 00:43:43,918
Pourtant, j’aimerais pas que
l’homme qui l’a tué vous échappe.

677
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,033
Ça va, il y a pas le feu,
on n’est pas aux pièces.

678
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:52,065
<i>Mon cher Peter,
je touche enfin au but.</i>

679
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,946
<i>Que d’émotion devant cette
simple bicoque tant désirée.</i>

680
00:43:55,076 --> 00:43:57,371
<i>Que d’émotion,
mais que de fierté aussi.</i>

681
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,035
<i>Hervé Claude, Jean-Claude Narcy,
faites place, ténors du journalisme !</i>

682
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:02,299
<i>J’arrive.</i>

683
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,941
Rentre, fouille-merde.

684
00:44:07,476 --> 00:44:11,016
Je vais te filer du biscuit sur
George pour ta feuille de chou.

685
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:13,417
Ça va fuser,
les potins, les ragots.

686
00:44:13,548 --> 00:44:15,308
C’est ma profession,
de témoigner.

687
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,967
Mes témoignages
c’est pas de la daube.

688
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:19,278
Mais je suis un peu surpris.

689
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,192
Au téléphone, vous m’avez dit
que vous aviez bien connu George.

690
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:25,177
Et que vous aviez
de vraies informations.

691
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:29,531
Il faut pas de vraies informations
pour vendre un journal.

692
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:33,311
La vérité, ça n’a jamais intéressé.
Regarde George, par exemple.

693
00:44:33,342 --> 00:44:37,030
<i>La vérité, c’est que pendant qu’il était
peinard, à faire du cheval…</i>

694
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:40,186
<i>… moi j’étais super loin
sur mon bateau. À la pêche.</i>

695
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,853
<i>Mais faut savoir la rendre
excitante, la vérité.</i>

696
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:43,894
<i>Moi à la pêche…</i>

697
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:45,186
<i>… lui sur son cheval.</i>

698
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:46,834
<i>Moi à la pêche…</i>

699
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:48,333
<i>… lui le cheval.</i>

700
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:52,000
<i>Ah ouais, c’est bon comme ça.</i>

701
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:09,165
Bon, on arrête
les déguisements.

702
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:10,261
C’est que des emmerdes.

703
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,709
Le journalisme total,
c’est totalement con.

704
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:13,510
Allez !

705
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:23,830
Patron !

706
00:45:24,051 --> 00:45:25,648
Il faut qu’on vous parle, vite !

707
00:45:25,834 --> 00:45:27,595
Vous voulez me parler
des chiottes, peut-être ?

708
00:45:27,632 --> 00:45:29,430
Non, de l’affaire Abitbol.

709
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:31,727
On veut laisser tomber
nos déguisements.

710
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:32,632
On en a marre.

711
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:35,231
Comme vous le sentez.

712
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:49,047
Mais c’est le sympathique
Dave que voilà.

713
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:50,579
Il a remis son
ancienne chemise ?

714
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:53,618
Voulez-vous être ma femme,
et après on boira un café ?

715
00:45:53,924 --> 00:45:55,323
Ça peut marcher.

716
00:45:59,437 --> 00:46:03,495
En y réfléchissant, ça n’a pas
une chance sur 100 de marcher.

717
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:04,585
On divorce ?

718
00:46:06,743 --> 00:46:08,939
J’imagine que j’aurai pas
de pension, radin !

719
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,390
Monsieur, vous savez parler
avec l’accent canadien ?

720
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:12,715
Ben évidemment.

721
00:46:13,193 --> 00:46:14,396
Il y a qu’à demander.

722
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,728
Mais George Abitbol,
vous pouvez m’en parler ?

723
00:46:19,395 --> 00:46:20,505
Monsieur Dave…

724
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:22,053
Comment vous
connaissez mon nom ?

725
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:24,975
J’ai vu le début du flim.

726
00:46:26,805 --> 00:46:29,805
Vous savez parler comme ça
en plissant le visage ?

727
00:46:30,443 --> 00:46:33,334
Ça a l’air facile ?
En fait, c’est pas évident.

728
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:36,040
Parlez-moi de George Abitbol
au lieu de jouer.

729
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:38,128
Mais vous pensez
qu’à travailler !

730
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:42,674
Je parie que vous êtes pas
capable de parler comme ça.

731
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:44,600
Oui, ça c’est vrai.

732
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,570
Faut apprendre, faut pas
rester comme ça !

733
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,062
On vit très bien sans savoir.

734
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:01,731
Salut, ça va ?

735
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,951
J’ai une proposition,
vachement bien, super balaise.

736
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,509
On serait deux irresponsables
payés par la CIA avec un hélicoptère.

737
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:13,747
Un hélicoptère ?

738
00:47:13,808 --> 00:47:18,294
Un super hélicoptère intelli-
gemment appelé Supercopter.

739
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:20,332
Ouais.

740
00:47:26,336 --> 00:47:27,337
Vendu.

741
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,111
Les cons !

742
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,546
Regarde, c’est lui, là.

743
00:47:38,635 --> 00:47:39,833
Qui, le jus de tomate ?

744
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,508
Non, l’acteur !

745
00:47:48,816 --> 00:47:51,808
Vous pourriez nous parler
de George Abitbol ?

746
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,805
Essayez de raconter votre histoire,
même sans ouvrir la bouche.

747
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,248
Ou vous pouvez la mimer.

748
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:07,237
Vous êtes un grand acteur,
vous devriez pouvoir le faire.

749
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:11,887
OK, je vais vous la mimer.

750
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:14,031
<i>J’étais à la cueillette
aux champignons…</i>

751
00:48:14,148 --> 00:48:16,452
Bordel, ça doit pas être
la saison, c’est pas possible.

752
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,227
Hep, Monsieur !

753
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:21,312
Oui, quoi ?

754
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:25,549
Vas-y, parle,
qu’est-ce que tu veux ?

755
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:29,334
Je vais vous poser une question,
si vous répondez bien
je vous laisse le passage.

756
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,910
Vas-y, pose ta question.

757
00:48:30,922 --> 00:48:32,720
Top ! Qui suis-je ?
Je suis un animateur de France 3.

758
00:48:32,773 --> 00:48:34,182
Je suis déguisé en noir.

759
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,669
Mon émission passe
tous les soirs à 18 h 35.

760
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,927
Je pose des questions
à des champions. Je suis ?

761
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:40,629
Tu es Julien Lepers, c’est ça ?

762
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:42,073
Oui c’est ça,
je suis Julien Lepers !

763
00:48:42,108 --> 00:48:45,001
Bien ! Sacré Julien.

764
00:48:45,858 --> 00:48:47,653
Hé ! Votre
encyclopédie Larousse !

765
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:54,683
<i>Après cet épisode j’ai croisé
très furtivement George Abitbol.</i>

766
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,934
Mon chéri ! Nous étions
séparés, mais nous voilà réunis.

767
00:49:03,213 --> 00:49:04,408
Tu vois cet homme, là ?

768
00:49:05,363 --> 00:49:06,787
Il est très connu.

769
00:49:07,323 --> 00:49:10,229
Par contre avant ça,
c’était un parfait inconnu.

770
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:13,076
C’est fou, non ?
Qu’est-ce que tu en penses ?

771
00:49:13,942 --> 00:49:15,639
Je pense qu’il est très grand.

772
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:19,331
Par contre, avant,
il était petit.

773
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:20,964
Hop hop hop !

774
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:24,767
Et notre répétition
de scie musicale ?

775
00:49:26,123 --> 00:49:29,018
Excusez-moi maestro,
je saluais des amis philosophes.

776
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:44,791
Merci de ce témoignage.

777
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,352
J’ai un trou de mémoire, quel est
le titre de votre plus grand film ?

778
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:49,060
Ou vous pouvez
nous le mimer.

779
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:52,040
Essayez de mimer le titre de
votre plus grand film, s’il vous plaît.

780
00:49:56,184 --> 00:49:57,979
Putain, il est costaud cet acteur.

781
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,389
Je pensais à un truc.
Tu l’as achetée où, ta veste ?

782
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:03,811
Comme mon fute, chez un mec
dans les Vosges, tu connais pas.

783
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,646
Ah ouais, c’est vrai que
tu es vosgien, toi.

784
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:12,282
Que je vous parle de George ?

785
00:50:12,323 --> 00:50:13,320
S’il vous plaît, oui.

786
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,210
Ce que je peux raconter…

787
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:18,121
… c’est que moi je l’ai
jamais rencontré, George.

788
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:21,068
Je sais que c’était l’homme le plus
classe du monde, c’est tout.

789
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:25,320
Je suis un type qui a fait
beaucoup pour l’écologie.

790
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,977
Je vous assure, c’est vrai.

791
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:29,229
<i>Si je vous disais qu’il y a rien
que j’adorais plus…</i>

792
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,210
<i>… que les chevauchées solitaires
dans les grands espaces vierges.</i>

793
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:36,400
<i>La communion intime avec la nature,
l’extase des sens.</i>

794
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,705
<i>Un sentiment grisant de liberté,
l’osmose, quoi.</i>

795
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:58,038
Dites-moi,
à propos de George…

796
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:00,176
… quelqu’un aurait eu
intérêt à vouloir sa mort ?

797
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:03,445
Un ennemi,
ou même un rival ?

798
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:08,395
J’ai entendu parler d’un type,
un dénommé Joël.

799
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,682
Il avait un ami manchot.

800
00:51:09,827 --> 00:51:10,726
Abitbol !

801
00:51:11,036 --> 00:51:13,433
J’ai peut-être qu’un bras,
mais je suis pas manchot !

802
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:14,457
Mais naturellement.

803
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:17,531
En puissance intellectuelle,
on va voir ce que tu vaux.

804
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:19,243
Mais avec plaisir.

805
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:20,931
Très bien.

806
00:51:22,103 --> 00:51:23,375
C’est une devinette.

807
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,397
Qu’est-ce qui a trois bras…

808
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,944
…un seul chapeau, deux
chemises et une veste…

809
00:51:28,142 --> 00:51:29,083
… un foulard…

810
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:32,601
… un pistolet et quatre oreilles ?

811
00:51:32,978 --> 00:51:33,945
Mais c’est toi, et ton…

812
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:41,136
Mais aucun problème.
C’est le cowboy de Tchernobyl.

813
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:43,342
Bravo, il la connaissait !

814
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,427
Au revoir, Messieurs-Dames.
C’est ça, la puissance intellectuelle.

815
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,614
Bac + 2, les enfants.

816
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,375
Ça sent la pluie, ça.

817
00:51:59,673 --> 00:52:02,469
On va rentrer, et on va
s’inventer une petite charade.

818
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,035
Et là, il sera bien feinté.

819
00:52:11,134 --> 00:52:13,549
J’espère que ce témoignage
va vous faire progresser.

820
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:16,027
Tous les moyens sont bons
pour arrêter le meurtrier.

821
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:26,500
Écoute-moi bien, garçon.

822
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:29,342
L’affaire Abitbol, c’est pas
une affaire pour vous.

823
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,347
Et mon patron n’aime
pas trop les fouineurs.

824
00:52:32,605 --> 00:52:34,104
Je vais te dire une chose.

825
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:38,185
Il y a de la boue qu’il vaut
mieux pas la remuer !

826
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:42,382
Qu’est-ce que tu dis ?

827
00:52:42,973 --> 00:52:46,180
On a reçu mes tricots de peau
en polystyrène expansé ?

828
00:52:46,186 --> 00:52:47,585
Je comprends pas,
ils auraient dû être là.

829
00:52:47,683 --> 00:52:48,888
Demande au standard.

830
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:50,422
Merci, on se sent vraiment aidé.

831
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,526
Oui, le standard,
vous avez rien reçu pour moi ?

832
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,675
Vous commencez à faire chier.
Quittez pas, j’ai un appel pour vous.

833
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:07,573
Allô, oui, bonjour,
Professeur Hammond.

834
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:11,266
J’enquête sur George Abitbol,
et j’ai des questions…

835
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,108
… sur votre père, Joël Hammond.
Je pourrais avoir votre témoignage ?

836
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:16,128
C’est bien.

837
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,554
Là j’ai un problème de costume,
mon tailleur se fout de ma gueule.

838
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:23,572
Mais ça va s’arranger,
je ne suis pas inquiet.

839
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:27,879
Chez moi cet après-midi ?
Vers cinq heures.

840
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:31,907
Attendez, il faut que je
me souvienne de tout.

841
00:53:31,937 --> 00:53:34,728
Chez vous, vers cinq heures…
Je vais essayer de m’en rappeler.

842
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,609
J’espère.

843
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,768
Purée !

844
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:48,803
Ça, j’aime ! Vous arrivez,
vous êtes même pas chez vous…

845
00:53:49,348 --> 00:53:52,343
… trois quarts d’heure de retard,
pas bonjour, pas merci…

846
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:54,964
… vous filez tout droit au frigo,
vous prenez la dernière bière…

847
00:53:55,855 --> 00:53:57,453
Vous êtes un sacré sans-gêne !

848
00:53:57,502 --> 00:54:01,245
Merci. Arrêtez, vous me
gênez, je vais rougir.

849
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:05,162
En réalité, j’aimerais que
vous me parliez de votre papa.

850
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,138
De Joël Hammond.
C’est possible ?

851
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:08,808
Bien sûr, c’est possible.

852
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:11,642
Je vais vous raconter
une histoire pas banale.

853
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,800
<i>Une fois, je devais
rejoindre mon père…</i>

854
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:16,607
<i>… dans une carrière où il
travaillait avec des ouvriers.</i>

855
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:20,329
Vive la révolution d’octobre !

856
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:24,555
On a repéré des animaux
préhistoriques partouzeurs
de droite dans les parages.

857
00:54:24,575 --> 00:54:26,469
Comment peux-tu croire
des conneries pareilles ?

858
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:31,065
<i>Avant d’arriver, je m’étais arrêté
pour faire boire mon cheval.</i>

859
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:37,899
Regarde !

860
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:41,525
Joël, n’y va pas, reste ici !

861
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:43,716
Je reviens, je dois y aller !

862
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:25,631
Ouais !

863
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,883
On l’a bien eu.

864
00:55:31,134 --> 00:55:34,425
Je déteste les animaux préhistoriques
partouzeurs de droite, bordel !

865
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:38,509
C’est de la merde, de
mélanger partouze et politique.

866
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,866
C’est mieux de faire
les choses dans l’ordre !

867
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,411
Va te faire branler,
trotskard.

868
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:47,023
Voilà. Et mon père, vous allez
me demander où il était…

869
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:49,222
… pendant que nous
on se battait ? Non ?

870
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,550
Dites-moi, votre père, où il était
pendant que vous vous battiez ?

871
00:55:58,671 --> 00:55:59,366
Joël ?

872
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:02,865
Il a fait comme à chaque fois
qu’il y avait du grabuge, Joël !

873
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:06,255
<i>Aujourd’hui il est mort.
Dieu ait son âme.</i>

874
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:09,511
<i>Je peux pas dire de mal, mais
pendant qu’on risquait notre vie…</i>

875
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,383
<i>… contre les animaux préhistoriques
partouzeurs de droite…</i>

876
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,946
<i>… comme d’habitude, il allait
s’isoler dans la montagne.</i>

877
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:18,440
<i>Personne n’a jamais su
ce qu’il faisait, d’ailleurs.</i>

878
00:56:33,736 --> 00:56:35,434
Ça daube, ça daube !

879
00:56:41,772 --> 00:56:43,878
S’il vous plaît, je peux
vous parler, Madame ?

880
00:56:43,969 --> 00:56:45,465
Appelez-moi Christelle.

881
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,879
Mon mari est absent.
Vous voulez voir mes fesses ?

882
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,669
Ensuite, je vous
roulerai une pelle.

883
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:53,910
Ce serait avec plaisir, mais
d’abord je dois vous questionner.

884
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,387
Comme vous voudrez.
Mais après, il faudra être mignon.

885
00:56:58,328 --> 00:56:59,246
C’est bien.

886
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,869
Je sais pourquoi vous êtes là.
Vous cherchez qui en voulait à George.

887
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:08,591
Je faisais l’amour avec lui du
samedi après-midi au vendredi soir.

888
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,266
À ce moment-là,
c’était un bon compagnon.

889
00:57:11,622 --> 00:57:12,979
Tu voulais me voir, chérie ?

890
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:16,559
Oui, je voulais absolument
que tu sois là.

891
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:18,391
Je tenais à te
présenter mon ex.

892
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:20,320
Oh, tu es lourde.

893
00:57:20,447 --> 00:57:21,850
J’ai très bien entendu.

894
00:57:21,992 --> 00:57:23,189
Bon, excuse-moi.

895
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:24,904
T’avise pas de recommencer.

896
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:28,001
Yves, je te présente George,
l’homme le plus classe du monde.

897
00:57:28,006 --> 00:57:29,702
George, je te présente
Yves, mon ex.

898
00:57:30,462 --> 00:57:31,668
C’est lui, George ?

899
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:38,290
Bravo. Qu’est-ce que tu fais
avec un mec pareil ?

900
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:43,442
Blablabla, j’ai les bonbons
qui collent au papier.

901
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:49,278
Je suis avec George parce que j’aime
les hommes qui ont de la classe.

902
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:50,922
J’ai envie d’aller aux gogues.

903
00:57:51,162 --> 00:57:54,369
Même si parfois les
apparences sont trompeuses.

904
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,834
Pauvre Christelle, ton mec,
je vais lui massacrer la tête.

905
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:00,460
Mais pas tout de suite,
non, pas maintenant.

906
00:58:00,698 --> 00:58:01,895
Quand il s’y attendra pas.

907
00:58:02,106 --> 00:58:03,402
Pas très courageux.

908
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:05,478
J’en ai rien à foutre,
d’être courageux.

909
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:07,331
Ce que je sais,
c’est qu’il va payer.

910
00:58:08,461 --> 00:58:11,149
Demain, ou dans
vingt ans, il va mourir.

911
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:13,408
Et pas de sa belle
mort, crois-moi.

912
00:58:13,424 --> 00:58:15,322
Tu préfères pas
qu’on fasse la paix, plutôt ?

913
00:58:15,565 --> 00:58:17,516
C’est tout ce que tu as à dire ?
Fais quelque chose !

914
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:18,613
Qu’est-ce que tu veux
que je fasse ?

915
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:21,333
Je sais pas, va te battre.
Notre honneur est en jeu.

916
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,378
Si c’est notre honneur,
vas-y toi, te battre.

917
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,860
George finit par se lasser de moi,
et partit avec une Québécoise.

918
00:58:27,973 --> 00:58:29,472
Une belle petite salope.

919
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:35,475
À propos de salope, avant votre
histoire, vous m’aviez proposé de…

920
00:58:35,574 --> 00:58:39,270
comment dire… de faire le…
j’aimerais passer à l’acte sexuel.

921
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,778
Oh, je ne sais pas…

922
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:44,940
Écoutez.

923
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:45,806
Oui, oui.

924
00:58:45,857 --> 00:58:47,461
J’ai plus beaucoup de temps…

925
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:48,770
Moi non plus.

926
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,680
Alors il faut que vous
preniez une décision.

927
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:52,879
Je suis à bloc. Dites-moi
si c’est oui ou si c’est non.

928
00:58:52,948 --> 00:58:53,944
C’est non.

929
00:59:12,402 --> 00:59:13,299
Allô Steven ?

930
00:59:13,368 --> 00:59:14,864
Bouge pas, Peter te prend
sur l’autre ligne.

931
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:15,920
C’est bon.

932
00:59:15,959 --> 00:59:18,245
Faisons un point. Je vais voir Yves
dans son restaurant…

933
00:59:18,247 --> 00:59:19,346
… ça se passe plutôt mal.

934
00:59:19,374 --> 00:59:20,373
Quoi ? Tu es pas mort.

935
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:24,317
Je me suis fait avoiner. Je me suis fait
casser la gueule par une brute.

936
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:26,772
Il voulait que je parle,
mais j’ai rien dit du tout.

937
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:29,745
J’ai pas dit où en était
l’enquête, malgré la douleur.

938
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:32,526
Heureusement que tu as
pas dit où en était l’enquête.

939
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:35,571
Vu qu’on en est au point zéro,
on serait passés pour des busards.

940
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:38,593
Pourquoi Yves t’envoie
son gorille s’il est innocent ?

941
00:59:38,795 --> 00:59:43,191
C’est à n’y rien comprendre,
même en réfléchissant bien !

942
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:46,537
Un mec au-dessus de tout soupçon
m’aiguille sur Joël, le rival de George…

943
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,688
… puis me fait dérouiller par son
homme de main. Pourquoi ?

944
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,904
Oui, pourquoi,
pourquoi, pourquoi ?

945
00:59:51,127 --> 00:59:56,319
Les enfants, écoutez. Je crois
que j’ai le fin mot. Suivez bien.

946
00:59:56,852 --> 01:00:00,109
George Abitbol s’est fait
assassiner par Yves.

947
01:00:00,484 --> 01:00:03,685
Le mobile : une femme, Christelle.

948
01:00:04,063 --> 01:00:08,107
Sexe plus histoire
de cul égalent…

949
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,885
… meurtre.

950
01:00:10,046 --> 01:00:11,937
Bien joué, l’enquête
touche à sa fin !

951
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,315
On va devenir célèbres,
on va bientôt niquer !

952
01:00:15,189 --> 01:00:16,386
Mettez des capotes.

953
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:20,203
Gorge Profonde ?

954
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:22,755
Gorge Profonde !

955
01:00:25,711 --> 01:00:29,203
Vous vouliez me voir ?
Vous avez des révélations ?

956
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:30,584
Oui.

957
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,208
Des révélations d’une
importance extrême.

958
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:39,668
George Abitbol est pas crevé.
Il est même vivant et…

959
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:44,230
Mais vous êtes ivre, vous empestez,
vous ne savez plus ce que vous dites.

960
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:45,436
Abitbol est mort.

961
01:00:45,525 --> 01:00:48,815
Pas du tout du tout.
George est vivant.

962
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:50,850
Et il est revenu en ville.

963
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:57,156
C’est moi qui te le dis, petit merdeux.
George est bien vivant, merde.

964
01:00:58,204 --> 01:01:00,302
Il est revenu pour
se venger. Voilà.

965
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:04,141
Et l’assassin de George,
c’est Yves.

966
01:01:04,306 --> 01:01:05,403
Ça, on le savait.

967
01:01:05,653 --> 01:01:10,388
Monsieur Je-sais-tout ! Si t’es
si malin, démerde-toi tout seul.

968
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,851
Et ma gorge profonde,
je vais la remplir derechef.

969
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:19,038
Quoi ? Il y a des voitures
dans les parkings maintenant ?

970
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,852
Je te connais pas,
j’ai rien contre toi…

971
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:03,188
… mais il faut que je
tape sur quelqu’un.

972
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:06,258
C’est pas de bol pour toi,
sinon je garde tout en dedans…

973
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,314
… et c’est pas bon,
alors tiens !

974
01:02:09,996 --> 01:02:12,107
Le prends pas mal,
mais tiens !

975
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,590
Qu’est-ce que c’est
que ce raffut ?

976
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,259
Alors, on peut plus
chier tranquille ?

977
01:02:22,418 --> 01:02:25,308
Abitbol, soi-disant l’homme
le plus classe du monde !

978
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:26,511
Du calme, Gaël !

979
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,654
Quoi du calme ?
Pourquoi tu dis ça ?

980
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,530
Babloche !

981
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:31,036
Oui, je suis un bab, et alors ?
Ça te défrise, vieux réac ?

982
01:02:31,386 --> 01:02:34,177
Parce que j’ai les cheveux longs,
tu flippes pour ton confort bourgeois.

983
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:36,325
Tu as un mauvais karma, frère,
si tu supportes pas les cheveux.

984
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,831
Désolé papy, mais j’ai ma
liberté d’expression capillaire.

985
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:42,975
Ça te fait chier, hein ?
Dis-le, George.

986
01:02:43,979 --> 01:02:45,378
Putain tu es nul !

987
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:50,431
Messieurs, George Abitbol.

988
01:02:50,445 --> 01:02:51,243
George !

989
01:02:51,986 --> 01:02:53,380
Mais tu es vivant ?

990
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,314
Un miracle ! Il marche !

991
01:03:03,685 --> 01:03:07,081
On va pas en faire un fromage.
Je m’en suis sorti sans problème.

992
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:10,141
C’est pas vrai, cette affaire.
Qu’est-ce que c’est ?

993
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:13,764
Qu’est-ce que c’est ce pataquès ?
Je suis là pour une raison précise.

994
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,364
Je veux l’adresse de l’homme
qui a voulu me tuer.

995
01:03:16,147 --> 01:03:16,947
Yves ?

996
01:03:17,163 --> 01:03:17,861
Ouais.

997
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,937
OK, j’imagine l’état dans
lequel vous devez être.

998
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,707
Mais soyez un bon américain.
Faites honneur à votre drapeau.

999
01:03:25,212 --> 01:03:27,804
Vous devez laisser la justice
faire son boulot.

1000
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:32,874
On aimerait bien vous aider.
Mais on a perdu cette adresse.

1001
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:35,575
Même si on voulait vous la
donner, on pourrait pas.

1002
01:03:35,696 --> 01:03:37,292
Vous me prenez pour une buse ?

1003
01:03:37,504 --> 01:03:40,700
Je suis l’homme le plus classe
du monde, bande de cons.

1004
01:03:40,735 --> 01:03:42,539
Du calme, Abitbol.

1005
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,747
Vous méritez même pas
que je m’énerve.

1006
01:03:44,805 --> 01:03:47,942
Je vais me débrouiller sans vous.
Merci pour votre aide.

1007
01:03:47,996 --> 01:03:49,703
Il a vraiment pris
la grosse tête.

1008
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,772
Alors George, qu’est-ce que
tu veux comme tuyau ?

1009
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:19,635
L’adresse du type qui a voulu
me tuer. Ça me fera plaisir.

1010
01:04:19,866 --> 01:04:22,860
Je commence à en avoir
plein le cul.

1011
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:25,297
Ouais, plein le cul. C’est vrai.

1012
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,490
C’est pas parce que je donne
à tout le monde des bons tuyaux
que je mérite pas un peu d’amour.

1013
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,913
Tu as raison Huggy, je t’aime.

1014
01:04:31,252 --> 01:04:34,143
C’est pas croyable.
Il faut que je m’énerve…

1015
01:04:34,153 --> 01:04:36,649
… que je te fasse mon numéro,
pour que tu me le dises ?

1016
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:40,955
Tu nous fais ta crise ?
Ta petite parano ?

1017
01:04:41,908 --> 01:04:43,409
Merci pour le feu, pigeon.

1018
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,110
Toi, ton tuyau tu as qu’à
te le mettre dans le cul.

1019
01:04:45,206 --> 01:04:51,301
J’ai vraiment besoin de toi.
Donne-moi l’adresse d’Yves.

1020
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:53,907
D’accord, mais
seulement pour du fric.

1021
01:04:54,164 --> 01:04:55,261
Ça te coûtera 30 francs.

1022
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,655
Ouais.

1023
01:04:56,718 --> 01:05:01,355
Payables en deux fois.
15 francs avant, 15 francs après.

1024
01:05:03,853 --> 01:05:04,737
Allez !

1025
01:05:13,694 --> 01:05:14,981
Patron, patron !

1026
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:16,805
Il faut qu’on vous parle, vite !

1027
01:05:17,587 --> 01:05:19,260
Vous savez que George
sort de mon bureau ?

1028
01:05:19,264 --> 01:05:21,097
Rien à foutre, il y a
plus important.

1029
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:23,810
George Abitbol est bien vivant.

1030
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:26,625
Bien joué, les gars.

1031
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,086
Yves ? C’est moi, George.

1032
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:34,773
T’inquiète pas,
je ne te ferai rien.

1033
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,537
Je suis venu pour faire la paix,
pas dans un esprit de vengeance.

1034
01:05:37,592 --> 01:05:39,986
Je sais que c’est toi qui as
essayé de m’assassiner.

1035
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,826
Je sais aussi que tu t’es jamais
remis de l’histoire de Christelle.

1036
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:44,515
Mais c’est du passé.

1037
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,182
Tournons-nous plutôt
vers l’avenir.

1038
01:05:48,452 --> 01:05:51,150
Je veux que tu
t’excuses gentiment.

1039
01:05:51,565 --> 01:05:52,960
Ouais, je m’excuse.

1040
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,516
Excuse-toi mieux que ça.

1041
01:05:54,891 --> 01:05:57,184
Pardon, je te prie de m’excuser.

1042
01:05:58,886 --> 01:06:00,288
Pardon mon doux seigneur.

1043
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:03,205
Pardon mon doux seigneur.

1044
01:06:16,645 --> 01:06:18,044
Éteins ta clope.

1045
01:06:44,926 --> 01:06:46,527
— Monsieur Peter !
— Quoi ?

1046
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:48,230
Vous avez un message de Dave.

1047
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,236
Vous avez une
clope ? Merci.

1048
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,327
Il est parti chercher George
dans l’hôtel de Yves.

1049
01:06:58,119 --> 01:06:59,417
Merci pour la clope, grosse vache.

1050
01:06:59,434 --> 01:07:01,141
— Bonne journée !
— Merci.

1051
01:07:00,786 --> 01:07:02,597
Vous avez l’heure, s’il vous plaît ?

1052
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,850
Oui, neuf heures une.

1053
01:07:03,968 --> 01:07:04,901
Vous êtes précis.

1054
01:07:04,906 --> 01:07:06,764
Oui. Vous voulez niquer
avec mon ami et moi ?

1055
01:07:06,813 --> 01:07:07,611
Oui, pourquoi pas ?

1056
01:07:07,966 --> 01:07:11,532
Répétez ça ? Vous avez
bien dit « Oui, pourquoi pas ? »

1057
01:07:11,705 --> 01:07:12,503
Oui, exactement.

1058
01:07:12,517 --> 01:07:14,915
Suivez-moi. C’est
quoi votre prénom ?

1059
01:07:14,923 --> 01:07:17,120
Sophie, mais tout le monde
m’appelle Sosso.

1060
01:07:17,284 --> 01:07:18,579
Mais qu’est-ce que j’ai dit ?

1061
01:07:18,764 --> 01:07:19,863
Il faut que je vous présente Steven.

1062
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:25,820
Steven ! Laisse
tomber ce connard.

1063
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:29,030
Victoire, vieux, victoire !
Viens voir par ici, viens !

1064
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:32,188
Madame Sosso, je vous présente
Steven. Steven, madame Sosso.

1065
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,350
Mademoiselle.

1066
01:07:33,355 --> 01:07:34,430
Asseyez-vous.

1067
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:36,849
Tiens, prends
une chaise.

1068
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:38,776
Dites-lui ce que
vous venez de me dire.

1069
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,084
Je lui ai dit que je voulais
bien niquer avec vous.

1070
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,518
Tu entends ça ?
Qu’est-ce que tu en dis ?

1071
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:45,348
Outch.

1072
01:07:45,306 --> 01:07:48,600
Et on n’est pas célèbres, on
n’a pas publié une seule ligne !

1073
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,585
Alors pourquoi ?

1074
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,823
Parce que je m’en fous.
J’ai pas de problème.

1075
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:54,547
Vous avez l’air tous
de tomber des nues.

1076
01:07:54,597 --> 01:07:56,828
Vous pouvez pas savoir ce que
ça représente pour nous.

1077
01:07:57,278 --> 01:07:58,691
Je flashe.

1078
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,211
Si je comprends bien, on s’est
tapé une enquête super dure.

1079
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,154
Alors que si on vous avait
rencontrée avant…

1080
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,055
… on aurait pu niquer tout de
suite sans même être célèbres.

1081
01:08:06,886 --> 01:08:09,681
Alors que pendant ce temps,
je me la suis donnée grave.

1082
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:11,858
Allez !

1083
01:08:21,077 --> 01:08:22,376
Patron, patron !

1084
01:08:22,908 --> 01:08:24,409
Il faut qu’on vous parle, vite !

1085
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,096
On voudrait prendre
notre après-midi.

1086
01:08:27,205 --> 01:08:28,600
On a un plan, là.

1087
01:08:29,092 --> 01:08:30,088
Attendez, les gars.

1088
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,770
On sait pas encore ce que
veut dire « monde de merde ».

1089
01:08:31,782 --> 01:08:33,876
« Monde de merde »… Ah oui !

1090
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:35,848
Mais Dave est parti
chercher George.

1091
01:08:36,005 --> 01:08:39,596
Dès qu’ils reviennent, on demande
à George d’expliquer.

1092
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:40,934
OK les gars.

1093
01:08:47,266 --> 01:08:48,498
Ça va, Monsieur Abitbol ?

1094
01:08:48,565 --> 01:08:51,759
Vous avez passé une bonne
nuit, sans être indiscret ?

1095
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:56,481
Au poil.
Et tu es pas indiscret.

1096
01:08:57,137 --> 01:09:01,186
Je suis majeur, et je fais ce que
je veux avec mon petit corps.

1097
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,583
Dites, pendant que je vous tiens…

1098
01:09:11,061 --> 01:09:15,692
… ça veut dire quoi « monde de
merde », sans être indiscret ?

1099
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:19,756
Tu te réveilles à 35 ans pour te
demander ce que ça veut dire ?

1100
01:09:20,459 --> 01:09:24,054
C’est pas que tu es indiscret,
c’est juste que tu es un con.

1101
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:29,168
En disant « monde de merde »,
j’ai voulu dire que le monde allait mal.

1102
01:09:29,658 --> 01:09:33,046
C’est un cri de révolte lancé
à mes frères opprimés.

1103
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,547
Finissons-en avec la
résignation et l’indifférence.

1104
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:38,091
Ouvrons les yeux !

1105
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:43,103
Partout l’injustice, le nationalisme,
l’exclusion, ça me débecte.

1106
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:49,404
Tu as entendu parler de
l’hégémonie du grand capital ?

1107
01:09:49,923 --> 01:09:50,622
Non.

1108
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:53,601
Tu t’intéresses pas
à la politique. Tu devrais.

1109
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:59,902
Faut se mettre au travail,
pour vaincre les fanascismes.

1110
01:10:00,022 --> 01:10:01,417
C’est un concept à moi.

1111
01:10:01,269 --> 01:10:03,667
Ça dénonce à la fois les
fascistes et les fanatiques.

1112
01:10:03,674 --> 01:10:07,309
Merci Monsieur Abitbol.
Vous m’avez ouvert les yeux.

1113
01:10:07,317 --> 01:10:08,723
Regarde plutôt la route.

1114
01:10:23,029 --> 01:10:24,425
Ah, monde de merde !

1115
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,866
J’ai bien envie de le dire
aussi. Monde de merde.

1116
01:11:44,325 --> 01:11:47,250
